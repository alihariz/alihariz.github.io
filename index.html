        <div class="section section-personality">
            <h3>Personality:</h3>
            <p>As mentioned on the left menu, I am currently studying at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; enrolling in Bachelor Of Computer Science (Software Engineering) With Honours. I like to think myself as an outgoing person that makes friends easily. The other day, my friend noticed that I could really get along with different types of people and got a wide connections. I think that is both a good thing and slightly bad thing since it is really good to have a wide network of connections between people in future but we also need a few really close friends that we could trust that would help us when we are at our bottom.</p>

        <div class="section section-achievement">
            <h3>Achievement:</h3>
            <p>I could name some Achievement that I've earned throughout my studies. To start, I have experience building a RERO robot and started to get into Computer Science in my early junior highschool years. During my senior highschool years, I have joined MRSM Innovation Competition where i joined the Engineering section which I built a robot trashcan using Arduino for the competition. My team project is then brought to STEM festival to showcase it with more features to it. Now during my studies in UTM, I have joined many Mobile Legends tournament. I also got myself into martial arts, Silat Cekak Pusaka Hanafi, where I am already at the end stage and have performed silat demonstration infront of the new silat intakes.</p>

        <div class="section section-interest">
            <h3>Interest:</h3>
            <p>Gaming all the way! If I have a free time after my studies, I would spend my time polishing my skills playing games like Genshin Impact, Honkat Star Rail and Mobile Legends. For Mobile Legends game, it is a competitive game and I myself have joined several tournaments within UTM in order to further polish my skills and reap the prize pool provided. I think it is a good way to spend my free time since we get much entertainment and might get some side money from winning the tournament as well. Other than playing games, I really like to listen to musics. Musics like English pop, K-pop and J-pop is my top favourites and I listen to them almost everyday. It's almost like I cannot imagine a life without music since I do most of my activities while listening to musics.</p>
